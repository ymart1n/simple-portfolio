        , I wrote my first line of code in Python. It may appear to be a bit
        late in comparison to people who begin coding as children. But this is
        the beginning of my story.

        One computer to all members in the family. Windows XP with interesting

        pirated XD). I'm very grateful for the amount of information I absorbed
        during the technology boom at my early age.

          stepping up to the next level. College Web programming course doesn't
          seem relevant anymore with current modern Web. Yes, I know they will
          say that the most important is the technique. But still saying that
          can also mean it is just same with teaching adobe flash to student.

          Sounds trivial. But I really am learning a lot by making a multithread
          cafe-simulation program. It teaches so many things on how to handle
          one basic problem but complicated in solving. How to handle the
          program flow, the responsibility of each object, connection between
          the relational object from different thread, deadlock, and many more.
          The most important is the convertability of this skills to be
          transfered to other field such making game or even requesting data
          from API in Web.
